# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on health-related features. The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which includes several medical predictor variables such as BMI, age, glucose level, and insulin levels.

## Project Description

The main goal of this project is to:
- Preprocess and analyze the dataset.
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
- Predict the onset of diabetes in individuals based on medical attributes.
- Provide insights through visualization and performance metrics.
- All steps are done in Google Colab, with no local installation needed.

This project can assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals at an early stage.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Open the Google Colab Notebook**  
    [click here to open the google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kycEXmR_n9Dok3XpgoBwpEV_oXYa883p?usp=sharing)
   
2. **Upload Dataset**  
   Download the dataset from [Kaggle - Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)  
   and upload `diabetes.csv` when prompted in Colab.

3. **Run All Cells**  
   The notebook will:
   - Import libraries
   - Load the dataset
   - Visualize data
   - Train a model
   - Display evaluation metrics

No setup, installation, or external tools are required.

## Sample Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree (optional)
